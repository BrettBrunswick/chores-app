This application was built to randomize the assignment of chores for roommates. The UI is pretty straightforward and provides functionality for any number of roommates with any amount of chores. Chores are 'weighed' with an effort level; Hence, harder chores will require more effort and each rommate may end up with a different amount of chores assigned.
